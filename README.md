**Bioinfo-Utility-Package**

An integrated package mainly devoted for anndata/scanpy workflow, helps you:

(1) perform statistics calculation that you usually need, but could be a little tricky;

(2) manipulate cellular identifications, this could takes lots of time especially when the quality of data is not satisfied enough;

(3) deal with your plot drawing and saving;

(4) plug your data in and out of some external tools, like CPDB.

**Installation Instructions**
Currently under construction. So just go import lol.
